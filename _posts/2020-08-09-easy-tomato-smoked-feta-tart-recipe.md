title: Sweet, jammy tomatoes with smoky and salty feta cheese
author: J. Kenji López-Alt
description: 'This is one of my new favorite simple,
  end-of-tomato-season dishes. It\''s only got about a half dozen main
  ingredients, but it\''s the way you treat them that makes it unique.
  Spicy, sweet, salty, buttery, smoky, and tart---there\''s an awful lot
  of stuff going on in here, yet it\''s the kind of recipe that\''s
  custom-made for an informal dinner party.'

### Why It Works {#why-it-works .title-section}
-   Salting the tomatoes and letting them drain before adding them to
    the tart ensures that your tart ends up intense and jammy instead of
    watery.
-   A layer of whole-grain mustard spread over the bottom of the tart
    adds a pungent bite.
-   A touch of liquid smoke added to the feta cheese brine gives it a
    lightly smoky flavor.


Ingredients {#ingredients .title-section}
-----------

-   1 teaspoon liquid smoke
-   5 ounces block feta cheese, with 1 cup of its brine (see note)
-   1 1/2 pounds ripe beefsteak tomatoes (about 2 large), cut into
    slices

    Carefully roll out cold pie dough into a circle that overlaps a
    10-inch fluted tart pan. Use your rolling pin to carefully transfer
    dough to pan. Push it into corners with your fingertips and trim off
    excess with a butter knife. Transfer to freezer for 5 minutes.

    Remove tart crust from freezer. Using the back of a spoon, spread
    mustard evenly over bottom surface. Layer tomatoes into tart crust,
    fitting them as tightly together as possible. Drain smoky feta
    cheese and crumble over the top. Season with black pepper. Drizzle
    with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with oregano,
    marjoram, and/or thyme leaves.

    Transfer tart to oven and bake until bottom is well browned and
    crisp and top is sizzling, with tomatoes and cheese lightly browned
    and most of the liquid evaporated, about 1 hour. Remove from oven
    and let cool to room temperature. Sprinkle with remaining herbs,
    drizzle with a little more olive oil, and serve.
