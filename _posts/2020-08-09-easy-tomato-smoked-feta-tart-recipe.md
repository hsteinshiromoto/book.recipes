    1.  Adjust an oven rack to the center position and preheat oven to 400°F. Add liquid smoke to feta brine, cutting or crumbling the cheese to make sure it is submerged. Set feta and brine aside.

    2.  Place beefsteak tomato slices and halved cherry tomatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with two layers of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Season with salt. Flip tomatoes and season second side. Set aside for 15 minutes, then blot excess liquid with more paper towels.

    2.  Carefully roll out cold pie dough into a circle that overlaps a 10-inch fluted tart pan. Use your rolling pin to carefully transfer dough to pan. Push it into corners with your fingertips and trim off excess with a butter knife. Transfer to freezer for 5 minutes.

    3.  Remove tart crust from freezer. Using the back of a spoon, spread mustard evenly over bottom surface. Layer tomatoes into tart crust, fitting them as tightly together as possible. Drain smoky feta cheese and crumble over the top. Season with black pepper. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with oregano, marjoram, and/or thyme leaves.

    4.  Transfer tart to oven and bake until bottom is well browned and crisp and top is sizzling, with tomatoes and cheese lightly browned and most of the liquid evaporated, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature. Sprinkle with remaining herbs, drizzle with a little more olive oil, and serve.

# Why It Works
* Salting the tomatoes and letting them drain before adding them to the tart ensures that your tart ends up intense and jammy instead of watery.

* A layer of whole-grain mustard spread over the bottom of the tart adds a pungent bite.
  
* A touch of liquid smoke added to the feta cheese brine gives it a lightly smoky flavor.

# Special Equipment

* Baking sheet
* 10-inch fluted tart pan 
* rolling pin

# Notes

If using feta cheese that's not packaged in brine, dissolve 1 tablespoon kosher salt in 1 cup of water, then place the cheese and the brine together in a small bowl or plastic deli container and follow the recipe as written.
