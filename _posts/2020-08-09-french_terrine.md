    1. **Make the Filling**

    1.a. Before you start cooking, place thinly sliced bacon (for the lining) and grinder parts in the freezer. We aren’t freezing them through here, just getting them real chill so they are easy to work with.
      * Bacon, thinly sliced, about 0.5 package, as needed

    1.b. Grind those spices in your spice grinder.
       * 2.5g Yellow mustard seed
       * 2.5g Coriander seed
       * 1.5g Black pepper
       * 1.3g Allspice
       * 0.75g Clove 

    1.c. Combine Salts by adding salts to a small bowl on your digital scale and stir to combine. Set aside.
      * 15g Salt
      * 1.5g Prague Powder No. 1

    1.d. Chop the meat, season, and get it in the freezer. Cut the shoulder, bacon, and liver into small chunks that will fit into your meat grinder Combine the meats on a tray, and sprinkle generously with your spice mix. Now transfer those meats to the freezer so they can hang with their buddies, grinder and bacon.
      * 550g Pork shoulder
      * 200g Pork liver
      * 150g Slab bacon for the filling

    2. **Make the binder (Panade)**

    2.a. Remove the crust from your bread, and discard. (We discard the crust into our mouths as a snack, but you do you.) Chop bread into cubes; you’ll need to end up with about 37.5g.

    2.b. Add bread, egg, and milk to a bowl, and blend with an immersion blender until you get a smooth, pastelike texture.

    Store in the fridge.

    * 37.5g Bread such as sourdough, crust removed
    * 50g Eggs about 1 whole 
    * 37.5g Milk whole
