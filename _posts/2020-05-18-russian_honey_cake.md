  directions_markdown: |-
    **To Prepare Baking Sheets**

    1.  Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 180C/375F.
    2.  Line 2 or 3 (or more) baking sheets with see-through silicon mats.
        On a large piece of paper, trace a circle around a 9-inch pie or
        cake pan and place the paper underneath one of the silicon mats. If
        you don\'t have silicon mats, trace the 9-inch circles directly onto
        11 baking-sheet-size pieces of parchment paper. Place a piece of
        parchment tracing-side-down on a baking sheet. Set aside.

    **To make the Burnt Honey**

    1.  Place 3/4 cup of honey in a 2-quart saucepan, and set over high
        heat. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium. Cook the
        honey, stirring occasionally with a heat-proof spatula, until it the
        color darkens and turns from pale yellow to dark amber; about 3
        minutes. Turn off the heat and carefully add 1/4 cup water. Allow
        the honey to sputter until it stops bubbling, then whisk to combine.
        Transfer to a heatproof measuring cup with a spout, and set aside.

    **To make the Cake Layers**

    1.  Fill a medium saucepan with 2 inches of water, and bring to a
        simmer. Combine 1/4 cup burned honey, 3/4 cup honey, sugar and
        butter in a large heat-proof bowl, and place over the pot of water,
        making sure the simmering water is not touching the bottom of the
        bowl.
    2.  Crack eggs into a small bowl, and set aside. Stir together baking
        soda, salt and cinnamon in a separate small bowl.
    3.  Gently stir the honey/butter mixture until the butter has melted,
        then whisk well to combine. Use your finger to test the temperature
        of the mixture. When it's warm, add the eggs while whisking. When
        the mixture returns to the same temperature, add the cinnamon
        mixture, and continue whisking for another 30 seconds. The batter
        will begin to foam and emit a curious odor. Remove the bowl from the
        heat, and allow it to cool until it's warm.
    4.  Place the flour in a fine-mesh sieve, and sift over the batter in
        three batches, whisking to incorporate the flour completely with
        each addition, until completely smooth. The batter will spread more
        easily when it's warm, so place the bowl in a warm spot, such as
        atop the preheating oven or over the pan of simmering water (off
        heat).
    5.  Spoon a heaping 1/3 cup of batter over the prepared silicon mat or
        parchment paper. Use an offset spatula to evenly spread the batter
        to the edges of the traced circle. Make sure that the entire circle
        is well covered, otherwise, add a little more batter in patchy areas
        and smooth out.
    6.  If using silicon mats, carefully slide the paper with the traced
        circle from underneath the silicon mat and place under another one.
        Repeat spooning and smoothing remaining batter until you're out of
        baking sheets. Ultimately, you should end up with 11 layers.
    7.  As you continue spreading the remaining batter on the baking sheets,
        bake as many layers at a time as possible, for 6 to 7 minutes, until
        the cake turns a deep caramel color, springs back at the touch and a
        toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Do not overbake!
    8.  When each layer is done, slide the silicon mat or parchment off the
        baking sheet to prevent overbaking. If reusing baking sheets while
        they are still hot, reduce cooking time to 5 to 6 minutes.
    9.  When the cake layers are cool enough to handle, examine them. If any
        spread outside the traced circles as they baked, use a sharp knife
        or pair of scissors to trim them. Don\'t throw away the trimmings.
        Before the cakes cool entirely, pull each one carefully from the
        silicon mat or parchment, then place back on the parchment or wire
        rack on a flat surface, and allow to cool completely.
    10. When all the layers are baked, reduce the oven temperature to
        120C/250F, and return the least attractive layer (and trimmings) to
        a baking sheet, and place in the oven to toast until deep reddish
        brown and dry, about 15 minutes. Allow it to cool, then use a food
        processor to grind into fine crumbs. Cover and set aside.

    **To make the Frosting**

    1.  Place 1/2 cup burned honey, dulce de leche and 1/2 teaspoon fine
        salt into a medium bowl. Whisk by hand until combined, then slowly
        pour in 3/4 cup cream and mix until homogeneous. Chill until
        completely cooled, about 30 minutes.
    2.  Pour 4 cups heavy cream into the bowl (preferring chilled) of a
        stand mixer, with the whisk attachment. Whip at medium speed to soft
        peaks, about 6 minutes, then add honey mixture and whip to medium
        stiff peaks. If your mixer holds less than 5 quarts, make frosting
        in 2 batches and then combine in a large bowl, or use a large bowl
        and a hand mixer.

    **To assemble the cake**

    1.  Assemble the cake on a 10-inch cardboard circle or flat serving
        plate. Place a cake layer in the center of the cardboard, then spoon
        a heaping cup of frosting onto the center. Use an offset spatula to
        spread the frosting evenly, leaving a 1/4-inch ring around the edge.
        Continue with alternating layers of cake and frosting, ending the
        last layer with frosting. Use any leftover frosting to smooth out
        the sides of the cake, but don't worry if the edges of some cake
        layers poke through the frosting; they\'re gonna be covered up
        anyway. You should use up all the frosting.
    2.  Place the frosted cake on a rimmed baking sheet and use your hands
        to press the sides with the reserved toasted cake crumbs. You could
        cover the top too if you prefer.
    3.  Chill the cake in the fridge overnight to give the frosting time to
        meld into the cake layers and soften them. Slice into thin wedges
        and serve cold or at cool room temperature. Cake can be made up to
        two days in advance. Refrigerate leftovers for up to 3 days.

The ultimate recipe for Russia's famous Honey Cake, that you're
likely to encounter.  Ten layers of soft, caramelized honey cakes that
taste like the fine marriage of Lotus biscuits, honey graham crackers
and gingerbread cookies, sandwiched between a cloud-like burnt honey and
dulce de leche whipped cream.  Unbelievably delicious!

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/full-ussian-mood.jpg)

Let's just start off by saying that I don't normally throw around words
like "The Best," "Best Ever" or "The Most Amazing" at any of my recipe
titles that easily.  Not because I don't think they *are*...because I
certainly *do*, otherwise you wouldn't see them here...but because the
definition of what makes something "the best" is very subjective.

With that said, I couldn't hold it back with this one.  Because I truly,
positively, deeply, sincerely believe that this is THE MOST AMAZING
Russian Honey Cake to ever exist.  And yes I haven't tried all the Honey
Cakes in the world; in fact I've only had 4 in my life, 3 of them were
made by me...lol!

It's just that it's so incredibly good, that it's hard to imagine how
anything could ever top it.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/russian-sliceup.jpg)

This masterpiece of a recipe comes from Michelle Polzine, owner and
pastry chef of San Francisco's [20th Century
Cafe](http://20thcenturycafe.com), where this towering delicacy is the
main attraction and the pièce de résistance.  Her highly acclaimed
Russian Honey Cake has captivated flocks of food writers, pastry chefs
and tourists from around the world, who were infatuated by its
amazingness.

So I guess I'm not alone on this one. But hey...you be the judge!

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sliced-bee.jpg)

I first heard about the charm of Russian Honey Cake (Medovik Torte),
which is also popular in other parts of Eastern Europe, a little over a
year ago, and the idea had me instantly struck with obsession.  The
thought of a soft, multilayer cake that tastes like a cross between
honey graham crackers, stroopwafels, and speculoos with a filling of
ethereal, creamy frosting, tickled my inner foodie and painted my
daydreams.

So as any cake enthusiast would do, I scoured the internet, looking for
recipes that would replicate the taste I had envisioned.  Most of them
seemed to revolve around the concept of making the cake layers from a
roll-out, honey flavored, soft cookie dough, and filled with a lightly
sweetened sour cream frosting.  Some variations called for pourable cake
batters to make the layers, and a few had a dulce de leche based
frosting.

I tried 3 different recipe variations, and while all pretty tasty, they
fell short of my expectations.  I'm mostly to blame, as I'm annoyingly
picky.  I later tried a slice at a restaurant in Cairo, and everyone who
had tasted it was very underwhelmed by it.  That's when I came to the
conclusion, that perhaps Russian Honey Cake wasn't for me.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/full-russian-side.jpg)

That is until a few months later, when I received my subscribed
newsletter from [Treat SF's
blog](http://www.treats-sf.com/2018/02/russian-honey-cake.html) in my
email, with a post that happened to be titled 'Russian Honey Cake.' It
felt like telepathy. Not wanting to toss the idea of the raved-about
cake altogether, because let's be real...it does sound very promising, I
read through the post.  She mentioned how the cake is the "signature
dessert" of 20th Century Cafe and waxed poetic about how dreamy it
tasted. [ Further research also revealed that it took Polzine years of
obsessive testing before nailing
it](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/magazine/secrets-russian-honey-cake-michelle-polzine.html),
and that's when I knew, that this could be the one I'm searching for.

And so I'm here today, to happily report back that it truly *is*.  THE
ONE!  An absolute perfection.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honey-slice.jpg)

Ten thin layers of soft, airy cakes that taste like the fine marriage of
Lotus biscuits, honey graham crackers and gingerbread cookies,
sandwiched between a cloud-like burnt honey and dulce de leche whipped
cream.

Though seemingly rich, it's surprisingly light, with pleasant notes of
slight saltiness,  bitterness, and tanginess that perfectly balances out
the caramel-y sweetness.

After finishing the cake, it's left to chill in the fridge overnight,
which allows the flavors to intertwine and the layers  to soak in some
of the frosting, which softens them up into melt-in-the-mouth bites.
 It's a thing of dreams I tell you.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inner-slice.jpg)

The secret that sets this cake apart from its counterparts lies in 2
brilliant twists rather than a special ingredient:

**1)  "Adding more butter to the batter, transforming the cookie-crisp
layers into thin, spongy cakes." That makes for a softer, lighter cake
that slices like butter.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honey-stack.jpg)

**2) Burning the honey used in both the cake and frosting, to the point
of caramelization!**

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/burnt-honey.jpg)

This trick not only adds a more concentrated and pronounced honey
flavor, but introduces toffee notes, bitterness and acidity, that was
otherwise brought through the use of sour cream.   This burnt sugar
revelation, combined with glorious dulce de leche (thick caramel made
from sweetened condensed milk), made for an incredible sweet and tangy
whipped frosting, that eliminated that need for sour cream.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/frosting-swirls.jpg)

Now I'm not gonna lie...this cake *is* a project.  It's not hard and the
process is pretty straightforward, but it is time-consuming and requires
a lot of hands on work.  The first time I made it, it took me 3 hours
straight, with only 30 minutes of down time.  That is of course
excluding the mandatory overnight chill in the fridge, before you can
dig in.

But trust me...the fruit of your labor, will be well worth the effort.
 It truly is a stunning, showstopping dessert, that is sure to create a
buzzzzzzzz in any special occasion.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/full-mood-sliced.jpg)

The second time I made this, which was for the pictures you see here, I
divided the work over the course of 3 days and the results were every
bit as delicious.  I knew I wasn't going to be able to both make and
photograph every step, as well as , the beauty shots, all in one day,
especially that I only shoot in natural daylight.  So I took a
stress-free approach, and made the cake layers in 1 day, and froze them.
 Then made the frosting and finished the cake on a second day, left it
to marinate in the fridge for 2 days, then took the final shots on a 3rd
day.  I'm telling you this, just to assure you, that you can relax the
process by making some of the components ahead of time, without
sacrificing the outcome.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/close-up-slice.jpg)

So!  Are you ready to do this?!  I most certainly am!

You first begin by **"burning"** the honey.  And by burning, we mean
more like **"caramelizing,"** so don't worry, the honey won't taste like
ashes, and yet a beautifully caramelized honey.  Speaking of honey,
Polzine uses *wildflower honey*, which is supposed to taste more floral,
but I wasn't able to find it, so I used regular ol' mainstream honey
instead.  So if you can find wildflower honey...go nuts!  But if you
can't, don't fret, honey from that commercial squeeze-bottle will still
work!

You'll want to cook the honey until it transforms from pale yellow, to
deep amber.  As soon as it reaches this point, remove the pan from the
heat and whisk in 1/4 cup of water.  So that's your Burnt Honey all
done.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/honey-stages.jpg)

Now you're going to take 1/4 cup of that glorious burnt honey and
combine it with regular "unburnt" honey, sugar and butter and set over a
pan of simmering water.  Stir until the butter has completely melted.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/melt-honeystuff.jpg)

The mixture should feel pleasantly warm at this stage, in which you're
going to whisk in the eggs.  Continue whisking until the mixture becomes
warm to the touch again.  At that point, stir in a mixture of cinnamon,
baking soda and salt.  You'll notice that the mixture will smell weird.
 That's ok...you're on the right track.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/eggs-and-cinnamon.jpg)

Now you can sift the flour over the batter in 3 parts, whisking well to
combine after each addition.  Batter should be very smooth.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/flour-honey.jpg)

That wasn't hard...wasn't it?

Now if you have several silicon mats, I'd recommend using those over
parchment paper, for 2 reasons.  First, less waste of paper, and second,
they release from the cake layers so much easier than parchment.  But if
all you have is parchment, then you'll go ahead and trace 9-inch circles
on 11 sheets of parchment and spread the cake batter on each sheet
(tracing side down).

If you have silicon mats, you'll just need to trace the 9-inch circle
over only 1 sheet of paper.  You'll then place this paper underneath
your silicon mat and get to work.

In both cases, you'll spoon a heaping 1/3 cup of batter in the center of
the circle, the spread it to the edges of the traced circle. Make sure
to slide the piece of paper from under the silicon mat, if using one,
before baking.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/circle.jpg)

These guys bake very quickly, so stick around.  They'll bake in only 6
to 7 minutes, or until they turn deep caramel colored.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bakedcircle.jpg)

Continue with the rest of the batter until you have 11 layers of cake.
 If any of the layer's edges look wonky, give it a trim using a pair of
scissors.  Then put these trimmings, along with your least attractive
cake layer on a pan and toast them in the oven.  Once cooled, grind them
into fine crumbs in a food processor.  Reserve those crumbs for
decorating the cake.  It's ok...you could steal a taste; we're human.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/crumb-making.jpg)

Now that the layers are all done, time to move to the frosting.  Now
grab a can of dulce de leche, and if you don't readily have it where you
live (I don't!), you can make your own with sweetened condensed milk, as
per [this
post](https://cleobuttera.com/pies-and-tarts/banoffee-pie-cups/).  Just
know that if you do make your own, they take 4 hours to cook, so plan
ahead and make it as far as a month in advance.

Back to the frosting.  Combine that yummy dulce de leche with salt, the
reserved burnt honey and then stir in heavy whipping cream.  Chill for
30 minutes (that's the down time I was talking about earlier...so now's
the time to catch your breath).

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dulce.jpg)

Phew!  Now that 30 minutes have passed, you can whip the remaining heavy
whipping cream until soft peaks.  Then slowly drizzle in the cooled
honey/dulce mixture.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/drizzle-dulce.jpg)

And whip until medium stiff peaks form.  Now's a good opportunity to
steal a lick.  So good right?!

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/dulce-whipped.jpg)

Assembly time coming atchya!

Spread a heaping cup of that amazing whipped frosting between each
layer.  It's going to look like a lot, but trust me and go for it!  Go
for more than you think you need, because remember the cake will soak in
some of it....so be generous.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/plop-frosting.jpg)

Now will you marvel at the beaut?!  I know you'll be tempted to leave
the sides naked, but covering it up is essential in softening up all the
layers.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/layered-russian.jpg)

Remember those crumbs we had saved for a rainy day?  Now's the time to
use them.  So press them all over the sides, and if you want, over the
top too.

![](https://cleobuttera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/crumb-stick.jpg)

Can we get a YAY! here because ladies a gentlemen...mission
accomplished.

Not quite, but the rest of the work is the fridge's duty, so you're off
the hook!  Let the cake sleep in there for a day or two.

# Recipe


While not difficult to make, this is a multi-step, highly involved cake
that requires planning ahead. Please read through the instructions and
the notes in the bottom of the recipe before starting. Note that the
frosting calls for a can of Dulce De Leche, which is readily sold in
some countries. If it\'s not available where you live, you can make your
own with sweetened condensed milk. Just know that it takes 4 hours to
cook, so plan ahead and make it as far as a month in advance. The
finished cake, needs to chill overnight in the fridge before serving.

# Notes

1.  Original recipe calls for wildflower honey, which has more floral
    notes. However, I used regular, mainstream honey, because I
    couldn\'t find it, and still ended up with stellar results.
2.  You can divide the work required to make this cake over the course
    of several days. If you\'re making your own dulce de leche, you can
    prepare it up to a month in advance. The cake layers can be baked
    and frozen for several weeks, then thawed when ready to use. Just be
    sure to cool the layers first, individually wrap each layer with
    plastic wrap, then store in freezer zipper lock bags in the freezer.
    Thaw completely before using. The finished, frosted cake can be made
    up to 2 days in advance.
3.  Here\'s [a link for those \'Bumblebee\'
